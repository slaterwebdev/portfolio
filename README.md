--Personal Portfolio Project--

Welcome to my personal portfolio project repository!

This project is a full-stack application designed to showcase my development skills, clean code principles, and scalable design patterns. While certain aspects of the codebase may appear overengineered for a site of this size, this is intentional. My goal was to highlight reusability, modularity, and dynamic capabilities that align with best practices for larger, production-grade applications. As well as further convey the skills I offer as a developer in both the front and back end of projects.
