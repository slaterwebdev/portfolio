PROJECT:

Personal Web development portfolio that acts as one central location for all key information about my career as an FE developer thats now moving in to the full stack space.

QUICK START:

- npm install
- npm run dev

PERSONAL PORTFOLIO PROJECT THEORY:

While this project is small to medium in size, I designed the folder structure to show how I would approach scalability for potentially larger codebases. The abstractions demonstrate how I’d handle a growing feature set and maintain clear separation of concerns.

In professional projects, I’ve found that modular structures help with maintainability, scalabilty and readability, especially when the team size or feature scope increases. I applied this structure throughout the project to mimic that approach.

I understand this level of abstraction isn't strictly necessary for a portfolio project of this size. However, I wanted to use this as an opportunity to showcase my understanding of scalable structures and leave room for potential growth as my skills and abilities are forever changing and adapting.

TO DO:
Using node.js build a backend that can handle form submissions from my portfolio's frontend, enabling me to store, process, and manage the data efficiently.
